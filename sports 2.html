    <h1>Eala back in Philippines; SEA Games stint looms</h1>
    <h4>Author: Maribel Liliana, 9:54 pm</h4>

<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Alex Eala has returned base to recharge first before preparing for a far nobler duty with the national 
      team after etching another history for Philippine tennis in the world stage.</br></br>

On the heels of her monumental entry to the Top 50 of the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) rankings following a 
year-long tour, Eala on Thursday finally came home with the Taal Volcano being her first stop.</br></br></p>

        <p>Eala, 20, is expected to be in the country for the entire month after revealing that playing in the 
          33rd Southeast Asian Games is part of her plans during a long break at the close of the WTA Tour season last week.</br></br>

She’s being eyed by the Philippine Tennis Association (PHILTA) to banner the formidable national squad in the 
biennial multi-sport competition slated from December 9-20 in Thailand.</br></br>

“SEA Games is definitely in my plans,” Eala then said after a Round of 16 campaign in the Hong Kong Open that 
proved as the final tournament of her stellar 2025 season.</br></br>

Her R16 finish added 12 more points to her total with now 1143 to barge into the Top 50 from No. 158 to start the year.</br></br>

She’s the first Filipina to reach the world’s Top 100 first and now Top 50, adding just another feather in her 
cap with a bevy of firsts for the Philippines whether in the junior or women’s division.</br></br>

Among those was a breakthrough WTA title in the Guadalajara Open in Mexico, a historic first-round win in the US 
Open main draw and a Final Four finish in the Miami Open marked by gigantic wins against former Slam champions Iga Swiatek, 
Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys.</br></br>

But Eala is not yet done, setting her sights on finally winning a gold medal in the SEA Games after netting three 
bronze mints in the 2022 Hanoi Games. She skipped the Cambodia meet the following year due to schedule conflict.</br></br>

Now with a full availability and an all-time high morale from a historic WTA Tour campaign, Eala also beams with the 
possibility of strutting her stuff at home when the Philippine Sports Commission and PHILTA finalize the hosting a WTA Tour leg 
early next year.</br></br>

It’s to be branded as the Philippine or Manila Open, a WTA125 tourney being eyed at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex 
under renovation or the soon-to-rise Philippine Tennis Center in Clark.</br></br>

"If it were to happen, I would be so happy and it would be such a milestone for Philippine tennis. Not just obviously 
for me but for everybody there because growing up, we never had these kinds of tournaments,” Eala said.</br></br>

“As long as I can remember, we never had any 15k or a professional international tournament. So to come in with a (WTA) 
125 would be such a big step and I'm proud of how far we've come. But it's only the start.”</br></br>
