    <h1>Student designers compete to create Filipiniana </br>at Tech-Know Fashion Show 2025 Tino’s onslaught</h1>
    <h4>Author: Casandra Salvacion, 10:32 pm</h4>

<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Fifteen groups of young designers and creatives from various universities and fashion design institutes in the country 
      competed in creating various Filipiniana attire using Philippine Tropical Fabrics. </br></br>

The final products are also the result of collaboration between students and weavers and communities that contribute to the
 production of local textiles. </br></br>

"What we wanted to do is to get them to work with Philippine textiles, Philippine communities as well and use them in their 
creations and this is actually the culmination of that engagement with a boot camp, mentoring and finally they have the runway to show their collection," said DOST-Philippine Textile Research Institute Director Julius Leaño Jr. on Wednesday. </br></br>

The criteria for judging for the Stitch-Off: Filipiniana-Coded Tech-Know Fashion Show 2025 held in Intramuros, Manila, 
include design, concept and adherence to the theme, creativity, craftsmanship, originality, sustainability, innovation in 
the use of textile materials, overall visual impact and potential for commercial production.

        <p>Flora de Corales of iAcademy in partnership with LPZ Abra Weavers won as 2nd runner-up.</br></br>

Beyond the Currents of Iloilo Science and Technology University in partnership with San Jose Multi-Purpose 
Cooperative was the 1st runner-up.</br></br>

Pagdizam sa mga Adlaw of University of the Philippines Cebu in partnership with Barangay Tan-awan Farmers 
Weavers Association of Negros Nine was named champion. </br></br>

According to a member of the UP Cebu team, Ruben Rae Langamen, they faced a big challenge in making their 
Filipiniana Collection. </br></br>

“Because of the earthquake, we were unable to use all the facilities because our facility was on top of 
buildings so everything was taken down, we were in the open area working until dawn so when there was an aftershock, we 
were able to evacuate quickly,” said Ruben.</br></br>

Their concept for their winning Filipiniana Collection was said to be their memories of playing traditional 
games when they were kids. </br></br>

According to their co-designer Faye Alvinez, “the bleaching felt like play for us, so the whole time we were 
enjoying everything.”</br></br>

They said they are very grateful for these opportunities to showcase the talent of young Filipinos when it comes to designing. </br></br>

The winners received a cash prize, a medal, and a gift certificate and the champion, a round-trip ticket to 
any domestic destination</br></br></p>
