    <h3> ● The New 'Five Nights At Freddy's 2' Trailer Promises Bigger Scares</h3>
      <p>The big bear with the bowtie is back.</br></br>

Blumhouse just released its new trailer for the sequel to Five Nights and Freddy's, and this time, the animatronics 
are wandering the wild and scaring a whole lot more people.</br></br>

For many of us, Five Nights at Freddy's offers an irresistible pull of nostalgia, and fans will likely show up to its 
sequel regardless of test audience reactions or how the first film performed.</br></br>

The horror series, based on the game series that became a viral YouTube sensation in the mid-2010s, follows a player 
character as they endure terrifying night shifts at Freddy Fazbear's, a rundown pizza parlor. The place shares conceptual roots with something like Chuck E. Cheese in that pizza, parties, games, and animatronics are involved, but the similarities end there. Because at Freddy's, the animatronics come to life at night and try to kill you.</br></br>

<center><img src="images\fnaf pic 1.jpg"></center>
<center><p class="caption">Five Nights At Freddy's 2 image from the trailer.</p></center>

The first film follows Mike (Josh Hutcherson), a young man who cares for his 10-year-old sister Abby (Piper Rubio). 
He's haunted by the disappearance of his younger brother a decade before. Desperate for work, Mike takes a job as a night 
security guard at an abandoned theme restaurant. There, he learns the lore behind the place's mysterious shuttering and
 meets the animatronic monsters out to get him.</br></br>

Five Nights at Freddy's was a significant box-office success, earning about $291.5 million worldwide against a $20 
million budget. At the time, it was also Blumhouse's best opening for a horror film.</br></br>

Critical reception was mixed; critics generally disliked it, while fans rated it higher, embracing its campiness and humor.</br></br>

But even among the fans, some found the series' first entry a little bit tame compared to the game. So the creative team 
promised to up the gore and terror in the next round.</br></br>

Speaking at CCXP Mexico earlier this year, Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum told the amassed crowd, "We took lots 
of the criticism saying it was not scary, lacked blood or strong scenes, we decided to implement all that in the sequel" 
(via Deducer on X).</br></br>

We're just hoping that Foxy gets some big moments in the sequel.</br></br>

Five Nights at Freddy's 2 will release on Dec. 3, 2025, in the Philippines.

<h3> ● ‘Wicked: For Good’ Poised to Cast Another Spell on the </br>Oscars as First Reactions Call It a ‘Heartbreakingly 
  </br>Tender Conclusion’ With ‘Jaw-Dropping Performances’</h3>

<center><img src="images\wicked 1.jpg"></center>
    
        <p>Is it time for “Wicked” to conquer the Oscars, for good?</br></br>

Universal Pictures’ musical fantasy sequel appears poised to match or exceed its predecessor’s impressive showing at the 
Academy Awards, based on the first social media reactions that were shared on Monday night.</br></br>

Director Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked: For Good,” written by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox, continues the story begun in 2024’s “Wicked,” 
which adapted the first act of the hit 2003 Broadway musical by Stephen Schwartz and Holzman. The follow-up adapts the second act, 
exploring the aftermath of Elphaba and Glinda’s diverging paths — one as the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, the other as the 
beloved Glinda the Good.</br></br>

The film’s Oscar prospects look strong enough to repeat last year’s 10 nominations, cementing the two-part adaptation as a 
genuine awards powerhouse, based on the most passionate reactions that have trickled in.</br></br>

If both Erivo and Grande are nominated again for playing Elphaba and Glinda, they would join a very short list, becoming the 
seventh and eighth performers in Oscars history to be recognized twice for the same role.</br></br>

Erivo already made history with the first “Wicked” becoming the second Black woman to receive multiple nominations for best 
actress after Viola Davis. Oscar winner Davis and two-time winner costume designer Ruth E. Carter are the most Oscar-nominated
 Black women in history, with four noms each. Erivo is currently tied with Octavia Spencer at three nominations (Spencer has one win). 
 Erivo’s two Oscar noms were for best actress for “Harriet” (2019) and the original song “Stand Up,” becoming the third person 
 to be recognized for acting and music in the same year. I’d keep an eye on Erivo being a frontrunner for the Globe in the lead 
 actress (comedy or musical) category. Whether that can be enough to topple someone like Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) will be a hurdle 
 the campaign will need to overcome.</br></br>

 <center><img src="images\wicked 2.jpg"></center></br>

The current landscape of the supporting actress race reveals a genuine — and increasingly promising — pathway for Grande to enter 
the thick of the conversation for her first Academy Award. Her performance as Glinda is a fully realized piece of acting that balances 
humor, heartbreak and show-stopping charisma. If the season’s momentum holds, Grande could find herself not only in the mix but 
a legitimate contender for Oscar gold.</br></br>

Self-proclaimed “Wicked” experts will often say the second act of the stage show isn’t as strong as the first half since it lacks 
a showstopper like “Defying Gravity.” However, Chu, along with writers Holzman and Fox, once again elevate the material, particularly
 in the incredibly emotional “For Good,” which features the most decisive acting moment for both women in both films (possibly the 
 most decisive moment of their careers). Tears will flow, rivers will rise, and Oscar contenders are solidified in those moments.</br></br>

The film features a mix of beloved songs from the stage musical and two new original numbers: “No Place Like Home,” sung by Erivo’s 
Elphaba, and “The Girl in the Bubble,” performed by Grande’s Glinda. Both tracks are penned by Schwartz, who also composes alongside 
John Powell. Added songs in beloved musicals like “Wicked” that are later adapted for the big screen are rarely considered “better” or even match the original material’s praise. Nonetheless, despite those presumed “flaws,” they can still be embraced by the music branch, especially if they are considered to be, in the best picture conversation. Those in the last 25 years have included: “Suddenly” from “Les Misérables” (2012), “Learn to be Lonely” from “The Phantom of the Opera” (2004), “I Move On” from “Chicago” (2002), “Take It All” from “Nine” (2009) and the three original numbers from “Dreamgirls” (2006) — “Listen,” “Love You I Do” and “Patience.”</br></br>

While both new “Wicked” songs may face mixed reactions, this is the three-time Oscar-winning Schwartz we’re talking about. 
The branch reveres the legendary musician. Both songs getting nominated might be too ambitious, especially with this stacked
 field unfolding (i.e., “Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters”). If one makes it, the smart bet is on “The Girl in the Bubble,” 
 considering its placement later in the movie.</br></br>

With “For Good’s” technical categories likely locked for recognition — including the previously winning production design 
and costume design — along with viable win-worthy makeup, sound and visual effects, you could pencil in “Wicked: For Good” 
for one of the 10 best picture slots.</br></br>

Whether it translates into more nominations or more wins is a question for the upcoming awards season to answer. One thing 
that feels certain is the “Wicked” phenomenon isn’t finished casting its spell on Oscar voters.
